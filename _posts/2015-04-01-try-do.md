## Try-Do pattern

The common way to handle errors in .NET is to use exceptions.
But there is a concern related to exceptions: if code fails to often, the performance of the module may become unacceptable.
The common solution for the performance critical methods, in which errors may occur, is to use the <a href=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229009(v=vs.110).aspx>Tester-Doer Pattern</a> instead. This pattern describes the following rules the method should follow:

* does not throw exceptions
* has **Try** prefix on the name
* returns a `Boolean` value which equals `true` if method completes successfully, `false` otherwise
* has an `out` parameter which will contain the actual result of the method if method completes successfully, `default` value otherwise

Unfortunatly the **Tester-Doer** pattern has several issues:
* The variable that will contain result of the operation must be explicitly declared before the call of the method:

```C#
int a;

if(Int32.TryParse("10", out a))
	// do something
```

* The implicitly captured closure of the output variable might occur:

```C#
public static IEnumerable<Int32> ConvertToInt(IEnumerable<String> lines)
{
	Int32 temp = 0;

	return from
				line in lines
			where
				Int32.TryParse(line, out temp)
			select
				temp;
}
```

* Cannot be used with `async` methods:

```C#
public static async Task<Boolean> TryConnectAsync(String address, out Int32 result)
```

##Try-Do pattern
Considering issues described above the pattern should be improved in the following way: 
* does not throw exceptions
* has a **Try** prefix on the name
* returns an instance of type that implements `ITryResult<T>`

```C#
/// <summary>
/// Provides an interface for types which encapsulates the results of the methods that implements Try-Do pattern.
/// </summary>
/// <typeparam name="T">The type of the data returned by a Tester-Doer operation.</typeparam>
public interface ITryResult<out T>
{
  /// <summary>
  /// Gets an instance of <typeparamref name="T"/> if operation was successful, default(<typeparamref name="T"/>) otherwise.
  /// </summary>
  T Result
  {
      get;
  }
  
  /// <summary>
  /// Gets a <see cref="Boolean"/> value that indicates whether an operation was successful.
  /// </summary>
  Boolean Success
  {
      get;
  }
}
```

The `ITryResult<T>` interface provides an extensible way to scutisfy any type of methods that follows **Try-Do** pattern.
