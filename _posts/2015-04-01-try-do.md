The common way to write performance critical methods, that may fail, is obsolete.
It is time to make some changes!

###Tester-Doer
The common way to handle errors in .NET is to use exceptions.
But there is a concern related to exceptions: if code fails to often, the performance of the module may become unacceptable.

The common solution for the performance critical methods, in which errors may occur, is to use the <a href=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229009(v=vs.110).aspx>Tester-Doer Pattern</a>.

This pattern describes the following rules the method should follow:

* do not throw exceptions
* use **Try** prefix on the name
* return a `Boolean` value which equals `true` if method completes successfully, `false` otherwise
* use `out` parameter that will contain the actual result of the method if method completes successfully, `default` value otherwise

Unfortunately the **Tester-Doer** pattern has several issues:

#####1. The implicitly captured closure
The following code will cause variable `temp` to be implicitly captured by the linq clause:

```C#
public static IEnumerable<Int32> ConvertToInt(IEnumerable<String> lines)
{
	Int32 temp = 0;

	return from
				line in lines
			where
				Int32.TryParse(line, out temp)
			select
				temp;
}
```

#####2. The `out` parameter cannot be used with async methods
The following code will cause the error: `error CS1988: Async methods cannot have ref or out parameters`

```C#
public static async Task<Boolean> TryConnectAsync(String address, out Int32 result)
```

###Try-Do pattern
Considering issues described above the pattern should be improved in the following way:

* do not throw exceptions
* use **Try** prefix on the name
* return an instance of type that implements `ITryResult<T>`

```C#
/// <summary>
/// Provides an interface for types which encapsulates the results of the methods that implements Try-Do pattern.
/// </summary>
/// <typeparam name="T">The type of the data returned by a Tester-Doer operation.</typeparam>
public interface ITryResult<out T>
{
  /// <summary>
  /// Gets an instance of <typeparamref name="T"/> if operation was successful, default(<typeparamref name="T"/>) otherwise.
  /// </summary>
  T Result
  {
      get;
  }
  
  /// <summary>
  /// Gets a <see cref="Boolean"/> value that indicates whether an operation was successful.
  /// </summary>
  Boolean Success
  {
      get;
  }
}
```

The `ITryResult<T>` interface provides an extensible way to scutisfy any type of methods that follows **Try-Do** pattern.

Now lets see how issues will be violated by using **Try-Do** pattern:

#####lambda functions:

```C#
public static IEnumerable<Int32> ConvertToInt(IEnumerable<String> lines)
{
	return from
				line in lines
			let
            	parseResult = SomeClass.TryParse(line)
			where
            	parseResult.Sucess
			select
				parseResult.Result;
}
```

#####async methods:

```C#
public static async Task<ITryResult<Int32>> TryConnectAsync(String address)
```
